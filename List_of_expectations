Tasks

Lidar

wiring working
data transmission (ros node that reads data and transmits to a ros topic)
slam node (building map based on lidar scans)
LIO (slam using the imu)

--end of lidar base code



Realsense

data transmission (ros node that transmits visual and depth data to ros topic)
ros translation (maybe photogrammetry)

-- split
visual for realsense
setup yolo v5 and train it on the potential comp data

depth for realsense
attempt to combine laserscan data from realsense with lidar (is probably not that important overall)



IMU

node for publishing imu data to LIO
potentially combining imu data with gps but idk


GPS

node to publish gps data



---- combining everything
mapping

object detection
3 dimensional map
gps location with direction data
POTENTIALLY -- compare current lidar image to realsense image. if anything is too close, dont run into it

need: end goal, physical object avoidance, line avoidance
computer vision -- viewing visual objects and directing the vehicle to avoid them
gps mapping -- recording location data from gps and imu to make an accurate movement map that can be compared to lidar scan or google map
3D map -- lidar creates an accurate 3d map of the entire course as it traverses it. it also records its own path
gps waypoints -- using gps to determine direction and distance based on waypoints

action determiner / path identifier -- program that decides, based on all of the input, which action is the best action (works for ramp as well)
